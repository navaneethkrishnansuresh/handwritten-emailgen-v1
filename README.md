## 💌 About This Project

This project began as an email visualization tool that simulates how a personal letter might look if written by hand. Instead of sending plain text, users can now generate ink-styled vertical images of their writing with spacing, jitter, fading, and handwritten fonts. The handwriting is drawn directly onto textured background images—perfect for mimicking notes, postcards, or vintage documents.
